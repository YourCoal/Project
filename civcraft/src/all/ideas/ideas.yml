Idea 001: Teleportation
Current Status: Development
Framework: Use features from BuildStructureList.java to make this happen, but have accessable from CivTutorial.java
Explaination: Basically, a person will have different options to teleport to. Why not list them all out? Of course, there will need to be ways so that people
cannot abuse this teleport system, and there needs to be limits. For example;

teleport_locations:
  - id: spawn (name)
    name: Spawn (display name)
    cost: 10000 (coins)
    cost_cal: false (uses custom calculation to determine cost, + set cost above)
    tp_cooldown: 10 (seconds, how many seconds until person teleports)
    tp_cooldown_cal: false (uses custom calculation to determine tp cooldown, + set seconds above)
    reuse_cooldown: 300 (seconds, how many seconds before this player can teleport again)
    reuse_cooldown_cal: false (uses custom calculation to determine reuse cooldown, + set seconds above)

So that is just a basic example of what a person can expect. Now, I also want to make it so people can teleport to other places in the world;

already coded in TeleportList.java

Idea 002:
Current Status: Thought
Framework: TrommelAsyncTask.java
Explaination: Instead of giving the ingots of everything, have it give the _____ Dust Ore, so that a person needs to smelt it or do whatever with it that we
still have yet to decide after all this time.
