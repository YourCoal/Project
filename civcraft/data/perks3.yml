# This controls all of the available perks 
# 
# Each perk has an ID which is correlated with the website.
# 
# When the user logs in, we async fetch the list of perks from the cake database
# Then display them in a list to the user. (icon list?)
# The user then selects a perk to use, and "activates" it, once it is activated
# the perk is marked "used" in the cake DB and cannot be activated again.
#
# Each perk has a component that runs on it's activation. For now the only
# component will be the CustomTemplate component which will confirm the town
# they want to bind the perk to. 
#
# We will use the SessionDB which will have a key-value entry with the perk id
# so that the same perk isnt bound twice, and so we can lookup the perks when we build.
