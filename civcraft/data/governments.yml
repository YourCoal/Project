#      CivCraft Governments
#     This is a basic configuration of governments, for now this is
#     pretty basic, and I'll have to come up with a way to make things
#     as configurable as possible.
#
#     id = unquie id for this government
#     displayName = name shown to players
#     good_rate = the amount at which each same-good type multiplies revenue
#     trade_rate = total bonus percentage for all trade revenue
#     beaker_rate = science rate, not used yet
#     hammer_rate = production rate, not used yet
#     upkeep multiplier = upkeep increases or decreases by this multiplier, not used yet.
