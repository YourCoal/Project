# This file contains information how how to calculate civ scores and town scores.
# Each object that a town or civilization owns can contribute to its score. The 
# weight of each of these objects is set here. Scores are integers.
#
# Structures and wonders are worth points as well, but are configured in the structure.yml
# The technologies are also worth points, but are configured in techs.yml

# The Civ score is the sum of all of the towns scores underneath them,
# plus this extra stuff.
town_scores:
    # How many points is each town chunk worth
    town_chunk: 100
    # How many points is each culture chunk this town owns is worth
    culture_chunk: 50
    # Points per resident in town
    resident: 1000
    # Points per coin in town treasury
    coins: 20
#
camp_scores:
    # Points per resident in camp
    resident: 500
    # How many coins = 1 point
    coins_per_point: 2
#

# Amount of coins each score point is worth, which determines the town's
# worth during selling.
coins_per_point: 5.0
